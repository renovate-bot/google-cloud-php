Any API service that\nreturns long-running operations should implement the <code>Operations<\/code> interface\nso developers can have a consistent client experience.<\/p>\n<p>This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method\ncalls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:<\/p>\n<pre><code>$operationsClient = new OperationsClient();\ntry {\n    $name = 'name';\n    $operationsClient-&gt;cancelOperation($name);\n} finally {\n    $operationsClient-&gt;close();\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Extends <a href=\"https:\/\/googleapis.github.io\/gax-php\/v1.18.1\/Google\/ApiCore\/LongRunning\/Gapic\/OperationsGapicClient.html\" target=\"_blank\">Google\\ApiCore\\LongRunning\\Gapic\\OperationsGapicClient<\/a><\/p>","examples":[],"resources":[],"methods":[]}
