Any API service that\nreturns long-running operations should implement the <code>Operations<\/code> interface\nso developers can have a consistent client experience.<\/p>\n<p>EXPERIMENTAL: This client library class has not yet been declared GA (1.0). This means that\neven though we intend the surface to be stable, we may make backwards incompatible changes\nif necessary.<\/p>\n<p>This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method\ncalls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:<\/p>\n<pre><code>$options = [\n    'apiEndpoint' =&gt; 'my-service-address',\n    'scopes' =&gt; ['my-service-scope'],\n];\n$operationsClient = new OperationsClient($options);\ntry {\n    $name = '';\n    $response = $operationsClient-&gt;getOperation($name);\n} finally {\n    if (isset($operationsClient)) {\n        $operationsClient-&gt;close();\n    }\n}<\/code><\/pre>","examples":[],"resources":[],"methods":[]}
