If the group fails to create this instance, it will try again until it is successful.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>CREATING_WITHOUT_RETRIES The managed instance group is attempting to create this instance only once. If the group fails to create this instance, it does not try again and the group's targetSize value is decreased instead.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>RECREATING The managed instance group is recreating this instance.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>DELETING The managed instance group is permanently deleting this instance.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>ABANDONING The managed instance group is abandoning this instance.
